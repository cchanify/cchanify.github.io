    <p>My name is Connor Hanify. I'm a cyber security consultant with Stroz Friedberg, in the digital forensics and incident response practice. Previously I was a student at Middlebury College, where I studied computer science and political philosophy.</p>
    <p>During my four years at Middlebury I helped captain the <content-link href="http://sites.middlebury.edu/ultimate/2018/06/18/middlebury-guy-pranksters-2018-season-recap/" target="_blank">Men's Ultimate Frisbee Team</content-link>, participated in our computer science club, MiddleEndian, and tutored students taking Data Structures and Computer Architecutre.</p>
    <p>I'm interested in technology, especially in products that help people live better lives. My computer science coursework at Middlebury was focused on systems track. I have experience writing low level C programs and peeling back the layers of abstraction that make computers and applications work. I'm interested in security, systems, and blockchain technology, although I'm always ready to learn new things. I'm a fan of the <content-link href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html" target="_"> Worse Is Better</content-link> UNIX philosophy and a lover of minimalism.</p>
